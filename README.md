# clockCode
Created a program that uses the computer's system clock and you are able to hold shift to choose to add a second, minute, or hour.
I did really well ensuring that the code properly took the computers time and allowed the user to add a certain amount of time. If I were to go back and redo the code for this project I would include more methods to make the code base a bit more modular so that I am able to improve and take away some of the code without affecting everything else. Some of this project was a little difficult (ie. adding seconds,minutes,hours to system time). I overcame the problems that I had use StackOverflow mostly. Using System time could be a good skill to use especially if I wanted to make a game like "The Longing" where you have to wait 400 actual days worth of time. I haven't made the program maintainable because when I was looking at various solutions for updating system time a lot of the options I looked at were deprecated.
